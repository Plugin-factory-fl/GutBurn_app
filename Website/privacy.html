      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="updated">Last updated: January 25, 2026</p>

      <p>GutBurn ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how the GutBurn app handles information when you use it. It is intended to satisfy the disclosure requirements of the Apple App Store and to give you a clear picture of our privacy practices.</p>

      <h2>1. Information the App Collects and Uses</h2>
      <p>When you use GutBurn, you may enter the following information into the app:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Weight (in pounds or kilograms, depending on your selection)</li>
        <li>Height (feet and inches, or centimeters)</li>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>Biological sex (for the BMR calculation)</li>
        <li>Activity level (e.g., how much you exercise per day)</li>
        <li>Days per week you train (optional, as used in the app)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This information is used only <strong>on your device</strong> to compute your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), and calorie targets (for example, for losing or gaining weight).</p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>All calculations are performed locally on your iPhone or iPad. We do <strong>not</strong> transmit, store, or share this information with our servers or any third parties. We do not use it for advertising, analytics, or any purpose other than to provide you with the calculator results inside the app.</p>

      <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
      <p>GutBurn does not send your data to external servers. Information you enter is used in the current session to produce results. We do not persistently store your inputs on our infrastructure. Any local storage, if used by the app on your device, is governed by your device and Apple’s iOS. You can delete the app at any time to remove the app and its data from your device.</p>

      <h2>4. Data Sharing and Selling</h2>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing or any other purpose. Because we do not collect or transmit your data to our systems, there is no data to share or sell.</p>

      <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>GutBurn does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or social networking SDKs. The app operates using Apple’s iOS frameworks and our own code. We do not use non‑exempt encryption for data in transit beyond what is standard in iOS.</p>

      <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>GutBurn is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided information through the app, please contact us so we can address it.</p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
      <p>Because we do not collect or store your data on our systems, the main control you have is over your device: you can choose what to enter into the app and you can delete the app at any time. If you have questions about your data or this policy, you may contact us using the information in the "Contact Us" section below.</p>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top of this page will reflect the most recent changes. We encourage you to review this page periodically. Continued use of GutBurn after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. If we make material changes that affect how we handle your information, we will provide additional notice as appropriate (for example, within the app or via the App Store product page).</p>

      <h2>9. App Store and Apple</h2>
      <p>GutBurn is distributed through the Apple App Store. Apple’s Privacy Policy and the App Store’s terms apply to your use of the App Store and to certain Apple services. Our practices with respect to the GutBurn app itself are described in this policy.</p>
